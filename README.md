## Business Problem Ascend aims to tackle
Traditional call center sales training is:

Time consuming: requires weeks of onboarding and periodic in person refreshers.

Inconsistent: quality of coaching varies depending on trainers and supervisors.

Hard to personalize: agents have different skill gaps, but training is often one size fits all.

Slow to adapt: by the time training updates reach agents, customer needs, products, or scripts may have changed.

Difficult to measure: managers struggle to tie training efforts directly to sales outcomes or performance metrics.

This leads to:

Longer ramp up time for new hires.

Higher turnover due to lack of support.

Missed revenue opportunities from poorly handled calls.

Inconsistent customer experience across the team.

## How the Ascend Addresses It
An AI-powered sales training platform:

Simulates real calls with AI-generated customer personas so agents can practice anytime.

Analyzes conversations in real time to provide instant feedback on tone, pacing, objection handling, and compliance.

Creation of personalizes training paths based on each agentâ€™s weaknesses and performance data.
